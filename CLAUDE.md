# Cartalith Gen1

> **New session? Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` first** — current state, next task, how to verify.

Single-file HTML worldbuilding tool. **The main deliverable is the newest
`Cartalith Gen1 v*.html`** (currently **v0.77**) — a zero-dependency HTML/JS/CSS application,
designed to open via `file://` (a local HTTP server is an accepted fallback for Workers/WASM
threads; `file://` must degrade gracefully, never break).

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `Cartalith Gen1 v0.77.html` | **Current** unified tool (~15.6k lines, 3 script blocks — see architecture below) |
| `Cartalith Gen1 v0.57/v0.6/v0.61…v0.76.html` | Previous Gen1 versions (kept; never edit in place) |
| `Cartalith_V1.915.html` | Pre-merge cartographic editor, kept as reference (routes, settlements, paint grid, politics, journey planner) |
| `assets/sample_pack.zip` + `make_sample_pack.py` | Reference CC0 asset pack + its generator (in-app importer) |
| `docs/` | HANDOFF, roadmap, plans, `docs/research/` reports |
| `tests/` | Headless verification harness (`run.sh`, stubs, 903-assertion suite) + `tests/perf/` Playwright A/B + UI-smoke harnesses |
| `legacy/` | Historical merge tooling — **non-functional here** (inputs absent); see `legacy/README.md` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Per-version engine log (v0.037 → current), moved out of this file |

## Working rules

- Finish one thing before starting the next. Confirm design before building.
- **New version = new file** (`Cartalith Gen1 v0.XX.html`); don't edit old versions in place.
- **Version naming: two-digit minor from v0.61 on** (v0.61, v0.62, … v0.70). `sort -V` compares
  the minor numerically, so `v0.7` would sort *before* `v0.61` — the `tests/run.sh` default and
  any "pick newest" logic depend on the two-digit convention.
- **After any change to the engine (script block 1): run `tests/run.sh`.** A change is not done
  until it passes (903 assertions green).
- Cross-version neutrality: additive/opt-in changes must be proven byte-identical to the prior
  version at defaults (FNV checksums of field/temp/rain/render at seed 12345, 256px, region).
- GPU (WebGL) code, Web Worker glue, and canvas interaction cannot be tested headlessly — flag
  them for manual browser verification.
- Never let unbuilt features read as regressions in conversation.

## Merged-file architecture

The Gen1 file contains **three sequential `<script>` blocks** plus one `<style>` block. Blocks
execute in order; cross-block initialization must not assume a later block has run (see the
`#carIconGallery` comment in the file for the established pattern — a later block performs the
init, not `setTimeout(...,0)`).

1. **Generator engine + app shell** (~8.0k lines, `const VERSION='0.77'`). The full
   `elevation_foundation` lineage: procedural heightmap/tectonics/climate/erosion pipeline,
   renderer, LOD/atlas, exports, UI wiring. Everything `tests/run.sh` exercises.
2. **Civ/politics layer** (~4.2k lines): factions (`CIV_FACTIONS`, deterministic golden-angle
   colours for appended factions), settlements/ways/icons/territory drape, ported from the
   Cartalith editor.
3. **Asset Library** (~1.2k lines, IIFE): the native asset-management page (AssetDB,
   collections, importers incl. sprite-sheet slicer, validator, pack export). Migrated from the
   old standalone compiler; assets travel with the project ZIP via `_alExportEntries`/
   `_alImportProject` hooks.

### Engine (block 1) essentials

One module scope, module-level globals, no classes. Resolution `GW × GH` (world mode = 2:1
equirectangular, region = 1.56:1, `GH = gridH(GW)`). Global Float32Arrays allocated in
`allocate()`: `field` (heightmap [0,1], sea level default 0.42), `stressField`, `baseField`,
`ageField`, `flexureField`, `heterogeneityField`, `resistanceField`, `volcanicField`,
`impactField`, `tempField` (°C), `rainField` [0,1], `flowField`, plus `plateId` (Int16),
`boundaryMask`/`boundaryType` (Uint8), `shearField`, and the nullable set below.

Pipeline (`generate()`): continentality → **`buildTectonicSubstrate()`** (warp → plates →
stress → flexure → base blur + age → heterogeneity → resistance → orogeny; also replayed by
`loadZip` to reconstruct the tectonic substrate exactly from the saved seed) → height formula →
normalize → volcanism + craters → **flow(area) → climate → flow(discharge)** (rivers accumulate
runoff — `computeFlow(true)` seeds cells with mean-normalised rain) → render. Canonical stage
order rationale: `docs/research/pipeline-order-audit.md`.

Erosion ops (droplet/stream-power/glacial/velocity) run in blob-URL Web Workers built by
stringifying self-contained kernels, with sync fallbacks; `evolveCoupled` runs the
climate↔erosion loop; `routeSediment` is mass-conserving. Renderer: per-pixel material mixture
via `materialWeights` (Σ=1), multi-scale hillshade, opt-in NPR styles, LOD/atlas tile pyramid
(IndexedDB-backed baking), Strahler/Rosgen river network. Export/import: `exportZip()`/`loadZip()`
— `params.json` + f32 fields + PNG layers + Cartalith-loadable `biome_baked.bin`/
`terrain_baked.bin`/`cartalith_grid.json` (+ optional atlas/asset-library entries).

Per-version details for everything above: `CHANGELOG.md`. Per-parameter reference:
`docs/GENERATOR_PARAMETERS.md`.

### Invariants (never violate)

1. `materialWeights` fractions sum to 1.0 for all valid inputs.
2. All Float32Arrays remain finite after every pipeline stage.
3. Coarse-grid (240×150) climate blur always uses CPU `blurCoarse()` — never GPU.
4. Nullable fields (`warpX`/`warpY`, `geoidField`, `tideField`, `continentalField`,
   `orogenyField`, `riverMask`/`riverFloor`) may be `null` — every consumer must null-check.
5. `deriveFromWorldStructure()` is called only from checkbox/archetype handlers, never inside
   `generate()`.
6. Transient UI state is never serialized (and `assetPack` is a module global, never serialized).
7. `v(id,val)` / `lab(id,txt)` are module-level globals.
8. The γC height term was deliberately removed — do not re-add it.
9. World mode seam: avg wrap delta < 0.12 (seed-dependent and occasionally near the threshold —
   don't tighten it).
10. Earth defaults (g=1) reproduce the previous version bit-exactly (asserted via g-toggle
    round-trip).
11. The worker kernels (`dropletKernel`, `streamPowerKernel`, `glacialKernel`,
    `velocityErodeKernel`) and the GENPOOL row-fills stay **self-contained** — no module
    globals; the suite rebuilds them from `toString()` and asserts bit-identical output.
12. **`generate()` completes synchronously when no worker pool is engaged** — no `await` may be
    reached on that path (`buildTectonicSubstrate` returns `false` sync / a Promise only on the
    pool path). v0.6 broke this and shipped 32 headless failures; restored in v0.61. The
    headless suite and any unawaited caller depend on it.
13. Frozen vocabularies are append-only, never renumbered: `BIOME_KEYS`, `KOPPEN_KEYS`,
    `BTYPE_KEYS`, `LITH_KEYS`, `CART_BIOMES`/`CART_TERRAINS`, pack slot vocabularies
    (save-format stability).
14. Keep CPU and GPU temperature lapse (`uLapse`) in lockstep.

## Verification

```bash
tests/run.sh                        # newest Gen1 file: extract engine → node --check → 903-assertion suite
tests/run.sh "Cartalith Gen1 v0.57.html"   # or any explicit target
node tests/perf/hash_gen1.js A.html B.html # Playwright A/B bit-identity battery (same-binary FNV hashes)
node tests/perf/perf_gen1.js               # timing harness (headless Chromium)
node tests/perf/smoke_gen1.js A.html        # Playwright UI-chrome smoke (onboarding/layers/presets/phase)
```

Stubs live in `tests/stub_head.js`; assertions in `tests/test_tail.js` — extend both when adding
pipeline stages or browser APIs. The suite covers the CPU paths of script block 1 only; blocks
2–3 and all GPU/Worker/canvas interaction need a browser pass.

## Roadmap
