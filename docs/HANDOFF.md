# Cartalith Gen1 — Session Hand-off

**Read this first.** Start-here guide for a new session. Pairs with `CLAUDE.md` (architecture +
invariants + working rules) and `CHANGELOG.md` (per-version history).

## Where we are

- Repo **`Achos0190/Cartalith_RC`**. This repository was seeded as a single snapshot upload
  ("Add files via upload") — the pre-merge development history (the `elevation_foundation`
  v0.036–v0.144 lineage, its branches and PRs) lives in the older `cartalith-gen1` repository
  and in `CHANGELOG.md` here, not in this repo's git log.
- **Current tool file: `Cartalith Gen1 v0.65.html`.** One self-contained HTML file, three
  script blocks (generator engine / civ-politics layer / asset library). The merge is DONE —
  there is no build step; the file is hand-evolved. New version = new file, two-digit minor
  (v0.66 next). Older `v0.57`/`v0.6`/`v0.61`/`v0.62`/`v0.63`/`v0.64` are kept and never edited.
- **v0.65 — UI/UX overhaul, the remaining scope cuts closed out.** Engine bit-identical to v0.64
  (checksums byte-equal all the way back to v0.62; headless **852 green** throughout);
  `tests/perf/smoke_gen1.js` grew **27 → 41** Playwright assertions. `docs/research/ui-ux-upgrade.md`
  §Status now shows every stage genuinely complete, not just scoped-down. (1) **Full pinned
  inspector**: the settlement/POI/label edit forms (name/kind/pop/history/…) now render IN the
  pinned inspector itself, not inline in the lists — `_civRenderSettlementList`/`_civRenderPoiList`/
  `_civRenderLabelList` only render rows + selection highlight now; `_civSelectedRowRefs` preserves
  the old inline version's live-row-patching optimization (no full list rebuild per keystroke) by
  handing the currently-selected row's DOM refs to whichever editor the inspector renders. Extended
  to a third group, the Placed-Icons list's own per-instance editor, so selection is single across
  all three (place/label/icon instance) — picking one clears the others. Caught and fixed a stale
  bug along the way: the label list's delete handler only refreshed the label list itself, leaving
  a deleted label's editor stuck on screen. (2) **Per-layer hotkeys** (§4.10): bare-key shortcuts
  (B/T/F/S/W/R/0) for the Layers popover's most-reached-for views, badge shown in the popover,
  guarded against firing while typing in any input. (3) **Assets/Export promoted to header
  utilities**: the tab bar is now a genuine two-position Forge/Atlas phase switch (just Generate +
  Explore) — Export became a header dropdown (`#exportWrap`, mirrors Import ▾ but stays open across
  internal clicks since it's a form, not a one-shot action list) and Assets became a plain header
  button (`_carEnterAssetsMode`) that enters the same full-viewport Asset Library takeover as
  before; exiting is automatic (clicking Generate/Explore always restores the canvas — no `_activeTab`
  changes were needed since Assets/Export never touched that variable's only two remaining
  consumers). Browser pass owed: the relocated inspector's feel end-to-end, the hotkeys in daily
  use, and the header Export/Assets controls.
- **v0.64 — UI/UX overhaul completed** (the stages v0.63 deferred). Engine bit-identical to
  v0.63 (checksums byte-equal all the way back to v0.62; headless **852 green** throughout);
  `tests/perf/smoke_gen1.js` grew **12 → 27** Playwright assertions. Highlights: **Edit tab +
  Generate sub-tab bar retired** (Generate is World-only; Tiles & LOD moved into Generate →
  World; Undo moved to the header; Civilization + Cartography moved wholesale into Explore);
  **"Places & roads (terrain)" retired outright** (engine functions kept, UI gone — it shared
  `state.places` with civ settlements, so its "Clear places" could silently wipe them, a real
  landmine now closed); a unified 9-button tool palette replaces every scattered `data-civtool`
  control, with Label + Icon newly folded into `_civTool`; a lightweight pinned selection
  inspector (later made "full" in v0.65); danger accents + confirm-when-non-empty on 3 destructive
  Clear buttons that had none before.
- **v0.62 — civ-layer UX batch + finalize milestone (user request).** Engine bit-identical to
  v0.61 at defaults (checksums byte-equal; 848/848 green). (1) Economy+Politics merged into one
  **Polity** section + an **∅ Unclaimed** faction pill (paint to erase territory). (2) Timeline
  slider fixed (phantom "0 AD" era on first Add-year killed; mid-drag rebuild no longer resets
  the thumb via `_civTlDragSrc`) and **twinned** — `#civTlSlider` in Polity + the Explore slider
  share `_civWireYearSlider`. (3) Places gain a persistent **History** field; POIs get their own
  collapsible list (`#civPoiList`, expand-in-place editor like settlements); **right-click
  context menu** on the viewport (edit/move/delete nearest, drop settlement/POI, info) with
  `e.button` guards so the right button never sculpts/drops. (4) **Bake ALL levels & finalize**:
  `bakeAllTiles(depth)` bakes the whole LOD pyramid (select 2–5) into the atlas, then
  `state.finalized` locks Generate → World (3D dials exempt), banners the panel, and guards
  `generate()`/`confirmRegenerate()`/`_manualTerrainActive()` — the project becomes a
  cartographic LOD viewer/editor; un-finalize reverses. Headless-proven: finalized `generate()`
  is a byte-exact no-op. Also: `docs/research/ui-ux-upgrade.md` (researched UI/UX proposal,
  phase-based IA / layers popover / disclosure / inspector patterns, staged rollout).
  **Browser pass owed**: Polity flow, slider drag feel in both places, POI list + History
  editor, context menu, full bake → finalize → viewer flow.
- **v0.61 — sync-`generate()` contract restored (repo review fix).** v0.6's
  `async buildTectonicSubstrate()` refactor made `generate()` await unconditionally, breaking
  the v0.135 invariant that `generate()` completes synchronously when no worker pool is engaged.
  Headless fallout: flat `rainField` for unawaited callers → 32 suite failures + a crash that
  aborted ~200 assertions. Fixed by making `buildTectonicSubstrate` return `false` synchronously
  on the no-pool path (Promise only on the pool path); `generate()` awaits only a Promise.
  Proven: suite **848/848 green**; FIELD/TEMP/RAIN/FLOW FNV checksums bit-identical to
  v0.6-awaited at seed 12345/256px. Now **Invariant 12** in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Same batch (repo hygiene): settlement-seed test no longer hard-crashes the suite on an empty
  seed list; `tests/run.sh` defaults to the newest Gen1 file (exec bit restored); dead merge
  tooling swept into `legacy/` (see `legacy/README.md`); `CLAUDE.md` slimmed to architecture +
  invariants with the 108-entry version log moved to `CHANGELOG.md`; real `README.md`.
- **Browser passes owed** (headless can't see these — accumulate from recent versions):
  the v0.6 3D drape view (orbit/pinch camera, drape re-upload), the `renderNow(rect)` brush
  fast path feel, worker progress/parity for the erosion ops, GPU R32F path, LOD/atlas
  interaction, plus the visual passes listed in recent `CHANGELOG.md` entries.

## How to verify (the discipline we hold)

1. `tests/run.sh` must pass — 848 assertions, CPU paths of the engine block. Extend
   `tests/test_tail.js` when adding a stage; stubs in `tests/stub_head.js`.
2. **Cross-version neutrality**: any additive/opt-in change must be proven byte-identical to the
   prior version at defaults — FNV checksums of field/temp/rain (and render where applicable) at
   seed 12345, 256px, region mode. `tests/perf/hash_gen1.js` is the Playwright A/B battery for
   render-path changes.
3. GPU shaders, Web Worker glue, and canvas interaction (zoom/pan/paint/3D) **cannot be verified
   headlessly** — implement, then flag explicitly for a manual browser pass.
4. Commit messages end with the session URL line (see existing commits). Push to the work
   branch; create a draft PR; ask the user if they want it watched.

## Key invariants (full list in CLAUDE.md)

- Don't renumber frozen vocabularies (`BIOME_KEYS`, `KOPPEN_KEYS`, `BTYPE_KEYS`, `LITH_KEYS`,
  `CART_BIOMES`/`CART_TERRAINS`) — save-format stability.
- Worker kernels stay self-contained (rebuilt from `toString()` in the suite — Invariant 11).
- `generate()` completes synchronously when no pool is engaged (Invariant 12 — the v0.6 lesson).
- Nullable fields (`geoidField`, `tideField`, `continentalField`, `orogenyField`, `warpX/Y`,
  `riverMask`) — every consumer null-checks.
- Keep CPU and GPU lapse (`uLapse`) in lockstep.
- World-seam invariant (avg wrap delta < 0.12) is seed-dependent — don't tighten it.

## Next / open

- The queued work tracked at the end of the pre-merge era (browser passes above) plus whatever
  the user asks next. Check `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the long arcs; recent `CHANGELOG.md` entries
  state per-feature follow-ups (e.g. cross-tile seam editing is the one genuinely open LOD item).
